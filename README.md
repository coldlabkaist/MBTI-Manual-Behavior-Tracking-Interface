# MBTI-Manual-Behavior-Tracking-Interface

MBTI makes manual behavior tracking on video fast and simple. 
Set a recording time limit and **ㅅhe player stops automatically**. 
Count behaviors **with quick keystrokes**, map the exact keys you prefer, **and export CSV data** to review what happened and when it happened.

## Features

- Time-boxed recording: Specify a recording limit; playback pauses automatically at the end.

- Simple keyboard labeling: Count behaviors with simple keyboard clicks while you watch. It can record up to four actions simultaneously.

- Custom key mapping: Assign your own keys for each behavior—no hardcoded shortcuts.

- CSV export: Save per-frame labels and totals to CSV for analysis and auditing.
